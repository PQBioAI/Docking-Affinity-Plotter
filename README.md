## Docking-Affinity-Plotter

Docking Affinity Plotter: Visualize and analyze binding affinity data from molecular docking experiments. This desktop GUI tool allows researchers to load docking results, generate insightful plots, and create a  PDF report highlighting top ligands, statistical analyses, and key visualizations.

## Features

✅ CSV File Loading: Accepts docking results with ligand names, binding affinity, RMSD upper bound (rmsd/ub), and RMSD lower bound (rmsd/lb).

✅ Data Preview: Preview the first few rows of the CSV in the GUI before analysis.

✅ Analysis & Plots: Generates multiple plots:

✅ Binding affinity distribution

✅ Density plot of binding affinity

✅ Box plot of binding affinity

✅ RMSD distribution (ub & lb)

✅ 3D scatter plot: Binding affinity vs RMSD

✅ Scatter plots: Affinity vs RMSD ub/lb

✅ Pairwise relationships among affinity and RMSD values

✅ PDF Report: summary

✅ Top 10 ligands by minimum binding affinity

✅ Top 3 recommended ligands

✅ Statistical analysis

✅ Output Management: Saves timestamped outputs in Downloads and opens the folder directly from the GUI.

✅ Progress Tracking: Real-time progress bar and status messages.
